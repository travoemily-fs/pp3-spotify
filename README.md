## 🛠️ Getting Started

> ⚠️ Ports 3000 and 3001 **must** be open to host and run this program. Make sure that you don't have any other applications running on these ports *before* you attempt launching.

This application requires the following software & packages installed on your device ***prior*** to use:
- Docker
- NodeJs
- Yarn
- NPM
- Chrome (recommended) *or* Firefox, Opera GX, Edge, Safari

**For Mac OS users:**
- Brew

After installing all prerequisites, you're now ready to set up your project environment with an `.env` file. You can accomplish this by following these easy steps:
1. Make a copy of the pre-existing `.env.dist` file
2. Rename that file to `.env`
   
**Copy and paste version:**   
```
cp .env.dist .env && vim .env
```
Once you've finished organizing your development environment, ensure that you have Yarn installed on your machine globally by opening a new Terminal window and entering the following command:
```
npm install -g yarn
yarn
```
For ease of use, this project is designed to run backend and frontend applications *cocurrently*. You only need to type in this command into your project terminal to launch and use the application:
```
npm run dev
```
With that, you're now able to run and interact with the application on `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice.
## 💡 Extra Considerations
If you prefer to run the backend and frontend applications *individually* as opposed to launching each program cocurrently, you can follow these steps:

**Run the backend server:**
```
code
```
**Run the frontend server:**
```
code
```
